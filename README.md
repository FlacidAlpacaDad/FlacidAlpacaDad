- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlacidAlpacaDad's ex live in girlfriend and childrens mother..abused in every way by Richard Hernandez for almost 20 years. We have 4 daughters together and he has made my life a living hell for over a year since we left him. I have soooo much more to say and explain and pray and strive to prove what he has done to me and how he has used our daughters as pawns in his revenge for me leaving him. His abuse is still happening in so many ways while he is still selling drugs and threatening and harassing and bullying us. This has to end. And he needs to be prosecuted finally for what he has done and continues to do. Tonight I researched more and realized how he has been using GitHub this entire time to infringe on my privacy as well as our teenage daughters even putting spy cameras in their room at his house and sending them to my house with listening devices after his visitations. I need help to make him answer to his guilt. His ego and narcissistic behavior must be shown and proven. And I will do anything I can to do so
